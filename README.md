# Just TAP to TIME IN TRAVEL
#### A colaborative Phaser game made to an online Game Jam with a time-travel theme

"Just TAP to TIME IN TRAVEL" is a game made originally for a [Yarquen's online Game Jam](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJcB-tKWsJE) with a "time travel" theme.

The main idea was to build a Proof of Concept, and for that, the [Phaser](http://phaser.io/) as framework was chosen because of its ease in development and by the use Javascript and HTML5 elements.

The gameplay is based on "mini-games" games like Wario Ware, where the player must follow an action for a fast reaction on the stage. Each stage is based on a specific era in time, so the player may find yourself running from a Dinosaur or in a gun duel in a western background. Also, this game uses the tap action ("clicking" with a mouse or "tapping" on a mobile screen), so you may tap really fast on a stage, tap only when something appears on screen and etc.

I really want this game to become a collaborative project, so everyone can build new stages or even improve the gameplay or graphics
